This code will create a spotify playlist based on a search for a specific classical piece, for example "Beethoven 3rd conducted by Solti". It uses AI queries to form the spotify query and sort through the tracks afterwards.
You'll need a developer account on Spotify and an OpenAI API key.
Oath2.py - to authenticate for Spotify
albums.py - this is the main code to run
main.py - an early version that doesn't work as well.
This isn't user friendly yet and hasn't been fully tested. Use at your own risk. The biggest risk is that you get a weird playlist.
